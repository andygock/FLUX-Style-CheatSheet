# FLUX.1 [dev] Cheat-Sheet

ðŸ›‘ Notice: This is a **work in progress**. It will not work as I have not generated the images yet.

Forked from [Stable Diffusion Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/SupaGruen/StableDiffusion-CheatSheet) by SupaGruen - many thanks for the great work! Work in progress to convert it to FLUX.1 [dev] artists and styles. This is generated with a simple prompt "style of [artist name]". I used ComfyUI with FLUX.1 Dev fp8 diffusion model with TeaCache and 20 steps.

This began as a personal collection of styles and notes. I was curious to see how the artists used in the prompts looked without the other keywords.

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/SupaGruen/StableDiffusion-CheatSheet/releases) and use it as your own personal cheat-sheet - **completely offline**.

## Artist Inspired Styles

- **Over 833 manually tested styles**
- Copy the style prompt with one click
- Search and filter
- One click to look up the artist via search engine

## Just the Data

All the information, but without preview images, is also listed in 'only-data.html'.

There, you'll find everything that's in the JSON data. Date of birth (and death, if deceased), categories, notes, and a list of artists that were checked but are unknown to FLUX.1 [dev].
